This repository documents my learning journey through the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge. The main goal of this challenge is to learn by doing and to gain practical experience with Databricks.

Instead of focusing only on theory, this challenge emphasizes hands-on practice. Each day, I work on exercises that help me understand how data engineering and AI-related workflows are built and used in Databricks. Along the way, I explore core concepts such as Apache Spark, Databricks tools, and basic AI use cases.

At this point, the repository is a work in progress. It contains my daily practice, experiments, and learnings as I move through the challenge. More content will be added and improved as I continue learning throughout the 14 days.
